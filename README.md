# CS-210-Portfolio Item
Portfolio item showcasing course work for CS-210

This project aimed to organize product information from a fictitious store, "Corner Grocer." It consisted of two separate codes, one in Python and the other in C++, with the Python code reading a text file containing product information, calculating the frequency of each product, and writing the data to a .dat file, while the C++ code provided a user interface for the user to interact with, allowing the user to print the frequency of each product, retrieve the frequency of a specific product, view a visual text histogram, and exit the program.

The error handling in the Python code was one of the strengths of this program, allowing for proper reading and writing of the .dat file. However, the code could be enhanced by incorporating a learning algorithm to detect trends in the data and provide more insights into the most popular products. This would require additional data entries and files from the store, but the concept is feasible for real-world scenarios.

Counting the frequency of each product in the Python code was the most challenging part of the project, but it was overcome by using an appropriate algorithm to resolve the issue of missing items or printing incorrect information. Creating the visual text histogram was also initially challenging, but a simple algorithm was used to print the histogram to the console. The tools and resources used to support the project included Python and C++ programming languages, text editors, and online forums and resources.

The skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework include error handling, communication between different programming languages, and clear commenting, formatting, and organizing of functions for maintainability, readability, and adaptability.

The program was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable by incorporating clear comments, proper formatting, and organized functions, allowing for easy modification to add more functionality in the future. These aspects of the code can be useful for other projects, especially as the complexity and scope of the program increase.
